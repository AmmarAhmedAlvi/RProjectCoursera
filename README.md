Instructions to run the code
----------------------------

Perform the following steps to run the code smoothly.

-   Download and unzip the project files in your work directory
-   Clone or download the run\_analysis.R source code in your working
    directory
-   Execute the run\_analysis.R source code

Code explanation
----------------

The code combines the training & testing datasets, and extracts
variables which contain mean or standard deviation to create another
dataset with the mean of each variable for each activity of a subject.

The code is written based on the instructions of the project assignment on Coursera
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard 3. deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.
